CHAPTER 1: AN OVERVIEW OF THE INTERNET AND THE WEB

                                   Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)

1. Define the term "Protocol" in the context of the Internet.
A protocol is a set of rules that computers follow to communicate with each other over a network. It ensures that data is sent, received, and understood correctly. Example: HTTP is used for web pages.

2. What is the primary difference between a Web Browser and a Search Engine?
A web browser is software (like Chrome or Firefox) used to access and view websites. A search engine (like Google) is a website that helps you find information on the internet by searching through web pages.

3. Define the World Wide Web (WWW).
The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of linked documents (web pages) that are accessed over the internet using a web browser. It uses HTTP to transfer information.

4. Distinguish between a static web page and a dynamic web page.

· Static web page: Shows the same content to everyone, written in HTML, and does not change unless edited manually.
· Dynamic web page: Content can change based on user interaction, time, or database input (e.g., Facebook feed, weather site).


                                      Group B: Long Questions (4 Marks)

5. Explain the client-server architecture of the web with a neat diagram.
In the client-server model:

· The client (e.g., your laptop or phone) requests data or services.
· The server (a powerful computer) provides the requested data or service.
· Example: You type www.youtube.com (client), YouTube’s server sends the webpage to you.

(Imagine a diagram with a user on the left labeled “Client” and a computer on the right labeled “Server”, connected by an arrow labeled “Request” from client to server and another arrow labeled “Response” from server to client.)

6. Describe the functions of the following Internet services: Email, FTP, and VoIP.

· Email: Sends and receives digital messages over the internet.
· FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Used to upload or download files between computers on a network.
· VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol): Allows voice calls over the internet instead of phone lines (e.g., WhatsApp calls, Skype).

7. "The Internet is a network of networks." Elaborate on this statement explaining how packet switching works.
The internet connects many smaller networks (like your home Wi-Fi, college network, ISP network) into one global network.
Packet switching is how data travels:

· Data is broken into small packets.
· Each packet travels independently through different routes.
· Packets are reassembled at the destination.
· This makes communication efficient and reliable.


                            Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)

8. A startup wants a low-maintenance website with the same info for all visitors. They are advised to use a dynamic website. As a consultant, would you agree? Justify your answer.

Answer:
No, I would not agree. A static website is more suitable for their needs, and here’s why:

· Cost-Effective: Static websites are cheaper to develop and host because they don’t require server-side processing or a database.
· Low Maintenance: Once published, static sites don’t need regular updates unless the content changes, reducing ongoing technical costs.
· Faster Loading: Without server-side processing, static pages load quickly, improving user experience.
· Security: Static sites are less vulnerable to hacking because there’s no database or server-side code to exploit.
· Scalability: They handle high traffic well since the server just sends pre-built files.
· No Need for Dynamic Features: Since the startup only needs to display fixed information, dynamic features like user logins, real-time updates, or personalization are unnecessary.

Additional Justification Against Dynamic Websites:
Dynamic websites require more resources, regular updates, and security patches. They are ideal for e-commerce, social media, or portals where content changes frequently based on user interaction—which is not the case here.

9. A user types www.google.com and gets "Server Not Found", but 142.250.190.46 works. Diagnose the problem and explain the underlying technology that failed.

Answer:
The issue is a DNS (Domain Name System) failure.

· Diagnosis:
  · The browser can’t resolve www.google.com to its IP address (142.250.190.46).
  · Since accessing the site via the IP address works, the server is online and reachable.
  · Therefore, the problem lies in translating the domain name to an IP address.
· Technology That Failed – DNS:
  · DNS acts like a phonebook for the internet, converting human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
  · If DNS fails, the browser cannot locate the server using the domain name.
· Possible Causes:
  · Local DNS Cache Corruption: Stored DNS data on the computer may be outdated or corrupted.
  · DNS Server Issues: The ISP’s or configured DNS server may be down or slow.
  · Network Configuration: Incorrect DNS settings in the router or device.
  · Firewall or Security Software: Blocking DNS requests.
· Solutions:
  · Flush the DNS cache (ipconfig /flushdns on Windows).
  · Change DNS servers to public ones like Google DNS (8.8.8.8).
  · Restart the router and modem.

10. A multinational corporation wants to share sensitive inventory data with suppliers but not the public. Explain which network type (Intranet, Extranet, or Internet) they should implement and why.

Answer:
They should implement an Extranet.

Why an Extranet is Ideal:

· Secure External Access: An extranet allows controlled, secure access to specific external partners (like suppliers) without exposing data to the public internet.
· Enhanced Security: It uses VPNs, firewalls, and authentication (like passwords or multi-factor authentication) to ensure only authorized users can enter.
· Collaboration-Friendly: Suppliers can view real-time inventory data, place orders, and collaborate without needing physical meetings or insecure communication channels.
· Cost-Effective: Uses existing internet infrastructure but adds security layers, avoiding the need for expensive private lines.
· Audit and Control: Access logs and permissions can be tracked and managed, ensuring compliance and security.

Why Not an Intranet or the Internet?

· Intranet: Only accessible to internal employees, not external suppliers.
· Internet: Fully public and insecure—unsuitable for sensitive data.
· Extranet bridges the gap between internal privacy and external collaboration.

Additional Consideration:
The corporation should also use encryption (SSL/TLS) for data in transit and implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit what each supplier can see or do within the extranet.
